	  most 5 elements now look at at most 1000 (related: RT#133078).


0.276   2020-05-30  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [test] Adjust that now that Number::Format::BigFloat is downgraded to
	  RuntimeRecommends dep [RT#132738].

	- [Bugfix] In table view, make columns that are mentioned in
	  table.fields result metadata shown before  Released-By: instead of after
	  those that are not mentioned. This bug is caused by a
	  misunderstanding of what firstidx() will return in case there is
	  no match. It is -1, not undef.

0.23    2017-01-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Remove embedding of Data::Check::Structure, Text::Table::Any,
	  Text::Table::Tiny (I don't feel embedding is elegant or worth the
	  hassle, we should fatpack/datapack only the scripts).

        - [Bugfix] Fix HTML output (</tbody> was too early).

        - [experimental] Embed Data::Check::Structure, Text::Table::Any,

	  not in data column.

	  metadata, if any.

	- csv: Avoid perl undef warning.


0.08    2015-11-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] csv output: Forgot to escape backslash.


0.07    2015-11-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add new format: csv.


0.06    2015-09-30  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Switch from JSON::Tiny to JSON::Tiny::Subclassable because the
	  latter can do pretty encoding.


0.05    2015-09-30  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Also try to use JSON::Tiny (embedded by
	  Perinci::CmdLine::Inline), because JSON::PP is not yet core in
	  perl < 5.14.


0.04    2015-09-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Make more suitable for use by Perinci::CmdLine::Inline.

        - Inline List::MoreUtils::PP::firstidx() (List::MoreUtils is a non-core
          XS module).

        - Allow to skip cleansing (because in Perinci::CmdLine::Inline we
          already cleanse result using embedded code generated by
          Data::Clean::JSON).

        - Switch to JSON::PP as fallback, because JSON::PP is core in perl >=
          5.14 (and JSON::XS is a non-core XS module). But we try to use
          JSON::XS first if it's available.


0.03    2015-09-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add $DATE & $VERSION.
